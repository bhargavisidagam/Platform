		<h2 class="title">What is VotePen?</h2>
		<p>
			<p>VotePen™ officially launched in January 2018 as a media aggregator website featuring user-posted content.</p>
			
			<p>VotePen initially started as a hobby project by a sophomore student in India. Due to the recent interest generated by the online community, this has evolved from hobby into full-fledged desire to create the website that will become the place where you can "Stay Updated"</p>
